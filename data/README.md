# Data Folder

This directory stores all datasets used by the telemetry simulator project.
It is organized into subfolders to keep telemetry logs, track definitions,
vehicle setups, and sample datasets cleanly separated.

## Purpose

- Provide consistent storage for simulation inputs and outputs  
- Allow reproducible experiments  
- Keep example datasets for demos and documentation  
- Store track maps and car setup configurations  
- Support future extensions such as exporting simulation results

Each subfolder contains its own README describing the expected file formats.
