# 🏎️ FSAE Telemetry Simulator

A modular Python project for simulating, analyzing, and visualizing Formula SAE (FSAE) telemetry data — including lap times, fuel usage, tire wear, speed traces, and race strategy metrics. Built to demonstrate motorsport‑grade data engineering and visualization workflows.

## 📦 Features

### Telemetry Generation
- Synthetic lap/session data (lap times, fuel burn, tire wear).
- Speed traces, throttle/brake inputs, and G‑forces (planned).
- Sector splits for detailed lap analysis.

### Visualization
- Line plots for lap times, tire wear, and fuel usage.
- Scatter plots for speed vs. distance.
- Bar charts for stint comparisons.
- Matplotlib‑based performance comparison tools.

### Analysis
- Pace degradation across stints.
- Pit stop impact on race time.
- Driver or strategy comparison utilities.

### Export
- Save telemetry data to CSV/JSON for external analysis.
- Easy integration with other FSAE tools.
